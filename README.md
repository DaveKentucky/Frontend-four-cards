## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Eggradients](https://www.eggradients.com/)

### What I learned

In this exercise I cpuld polish up my skills of using grids and flexboxes in CSS for styling websites in a modern way. The most interesting was probably the usage of borders shown in the template design. This task was also a great opportunity to focus even more on mobile design, which is crucial in web design nowadays.

### Continued development

After the completion of this task I want to focus even more on manipuating fonts and colors in web design. Another thing is grid display, which still needs more practice to get really comfortable with. I am also going to try another way to simplify CSS modification (SASS or Bootstrap).
